# Reduction of Class Activation Uncertainty with Background Information

## Abstract: Multitask learning is a popular approach to training high-performing neural networks with improved generalization. In this paper, we propose a background class to achieve improved generalization at a lower computation compared to multitask learning to help researchers and organizations with limited computation power. We also present a methodology for selecting background images and discuss potential future improvements. We apply our approach to several datasets and achieved improved generalization with much lower computation. We also investigate class activation mappings (CAMs) of the trained model and observed the tendency towards looking at a bigger picture in a few class classification problems with the proposed model training methodology.
